# Simple survey maker app

This is a simple rails application I created for taking anonymous surveys. I found that using google forms was clunky and worked slowly from Mobile. In addition, I wanted more freedom with the UI and filtering content, so a simple browser based mobile application seemed suitable.

Todo: 

- Add admin comments form to the answer edit page.
- Prettify the UI
- Etc
